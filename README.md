# The Shite Reliability Engineering Manifesto

* We all want to get code to production quicker, so why not take Continuous Delivery to its conclusion and vim on the server?
* Canary Deployments are great.  Half measures are not.  Go 100% or go home.
* Every advancement since the 1970's has been a waste of time.  There are no computer science problems in existence that cannot be solved with a combination of `sed` & `awk`
* Always make sure you containerise everything and use advanced scheduling software. This way you can make sure your infrastructure is ready when that static website suddenly becomes a complex financial analysis platform.
