# The Shite Reliability Engineering Manifesto

* We all want to get code to production quicker, so why not take Continuous Delivery to its conclusion and vim on the server?
* Canary Deployments are great.  Half measures are not.  Go 100% or go home.
* Chaos Engineering - it's a lot of work, just embrace it.  You're no match for that Butterfly anyway.
* Schr√∂dinger's cat also applies to data.  Your backups are useless, as they do, in fact, exist in both a clean and corrupted state.
* Every advancement since the 1970's has been a waste of time.  There are no computer science problems in existence that cannot be solved with a combination of `sed` & `awk`
